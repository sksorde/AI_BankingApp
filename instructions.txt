Prepare a prompt for following AI hackathon problem with given inputs: 
AI powered Voice & Vision Banking Assistant for the visually Impaired
Brief Description of Accessibility Problem Statement:
Visually impaired users face major challenges while using digital banking applications such as reading on-screen content, entering OTPs, identifying transaction details, and detecting fraud alerts. Most banking apps are highly visual and require precise touch interaction, making them difficult or unsafe for blind users to operate independently. This leads to dependency on others and increase the risk of financial fraud.

Clarity of the Solution: Working AI solution with Solution articulation, target personas and  value proposition; Relevant AI techniques (LLMs, CNNs, transformers, classical ML, etc.) with proper model selection, training, and evaluation
Innovation & Creativity of the technical solution: Creative use of AI, novel combinations of techniques, or innovative approaches to solve selected problems; Highlight any use of generative AI for accessibility (e.g., auto-captioning, alt-text generation).
Accessibility & Inclusivity of the solution:  Solutions must meet basic W3C accessibility standards such as- all interactive elements should be fully operable via keyboard , and media content—images, charts, videos—must include descriptive alt text or ARIA labels for assistive technologies. The solution should not be siloed for people with disabilities unless the problem statement explicitly targets that audience. Instead, it should adopt inclusive design principles that enhance usability and experience for all users, making accessibility a core part of the overall UX; Documentation of bias mitigation strategies.
Business Impact of the solution: How significantly does the solution contribute to organizational goals such as improving efficiency, expanding reach, reducing costs, or creating new opportunities?
